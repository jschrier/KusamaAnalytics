At the 2020 [Armory Show](https://www.thearmoryshow.com), I saw a painting by Yayoi Kusama and [was curious about the size distribution](https://twitter.com/JoshuaSchrier/status/1236394376273842176).

So I took a picture and when I got home, I wrote a bit of Mathematica code to analyze it.  I've never done any image processing before (in any language), so I relied heavily on a [blog post by Shadi Ashnai](https://blog.wolfram.com/2012/01/04/how-to-count-cells-annihilate-sailboats-and-warp-the-mona-lisa/).

Some moderate fun ensued.  I posted some of the highlights in the [twitter thread](https://blog.wolfram.com/2012/01/04/how-to-count-cells-annihilate-sailboats-and-warp-the-mona-lisa/).   

I suppose that armed with empirical distribution of radii, the total circle density, and the knowledge that they're mostly uniformly distributed across the surface (except for some anomalies near the bottom)...one could in principle generate generate these programmatically...
